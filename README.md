# ðŸ§¾ Description
This an application to show the encryption and decryption with the old methods.
For now I just add [`Caesar`](./src/app/caesar/page.tsx) and [`Transposition`](./src/app/transposition/page.tsx).
You can fork and add more methods and might be in the future I added more methods ðŸ˜Š.
